# Skeleton

Provide a placeholder while you wait for content to load, or to visualise content that doesn't exist yet.

## When To Use

* When a resource needs long time to load.

* When the component contains lots of information, such as List or Card.

* Only works when loading data for the first time.

* Could be replaced by Spin in any situation, but can provide a better user experience.
